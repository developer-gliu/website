        <p>Hi everyone! I'm George Liu. I'm based out of the Bay Area and currently working as a software engineer. In my free time, I like to exercise, play piano, 
            and go shopping. </p>
            
            I have a solid background in hardware engineering concepts from my time at Undergrad, but I now focus on software development and data analysis all while
            being able to view these topics through both a developer and customer standpoint. 

            From developing predictive models to uncovering patterns in complex datasets, I'm fascinated by the power of data to drive meaningful change.
            As I continue to explore the intersections of technology, data, and business, I'm excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams to create impactful solutions that address 
            real-world challenges. I believe that by combining my technical skills with my understanding of economics, I can contribute to projects that drive both technological innovation
            and economic value.</p>

    <section id="education">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering (with a focus on machine learning and controls) from the University of California, San Diego. Many of my core classes
            started off with hardware concepts, such as analog/digital circuits as well as system stability control, but eventually I found the topics of machine learning, data analysis, 
            and recommendation systems which were more interesting to me. In addition to these topics, I also studied economics, taking courses to understand global markets as well as econometrics.
            Finally, I recently completed IBM's global sales school, where I learned how to interact with potential clients through negotiation, objection handling, and managing different resources
            as products are developed through multiple teams.
