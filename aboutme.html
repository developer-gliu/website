        <p>Hi everyone! I'm George Liu. I hold a diverse background, having studied both Electrical Engineering and Economics at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). 
            With a solid foundation in these disciplines, I have delved into the exciting world of software development, data science, and machine learning all while being able to view these
            topics through both a developer and customer standpoint. Throughout my academic journey, I've honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, blending the principles of engineering
            and economics to approach challenges from unique angles. My passion for technology led me to explore the realm of software development, where I've had the opportunity to contribute 
            to cutting-edge projects.</p>
        <p>During my internships and job experiences,  I've leveraged data-driven insights to make informed decisions and create innovative solutions for distribution optimization. 
            From developing predictive models to uncovering patterns in complex datasets, I'm fascinated by the power of data to drive meaningful change.
            As I continue to explore the intersections of technology, data, and business, I'm excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams to create impactful solutions that address 
            real-world challenges. I believe that by combining my technical skills with my understanding of economics, I can contribute to projects that drive both technological innovation
            and economic value.</p>
