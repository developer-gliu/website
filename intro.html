                <h2> Hi, I'm George!</h2>
                <p> I have solid fundamentals in hardware engineering concepts from my time at Undergrad, but I now focus on software development and data analysis while
                    being able to view these topics through both a developer and customer standpoint. 
        
                    From developing predictive models to uncovering patterns in complex datasets, I'm fascinated by the power of data to drive meaningful change.
                    As I continue to explore the intersections of technology, data, and business, I'm excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams to create 
                    impactful solutions that address real-world challenges. I believe that by combining my technical skills with my understanding of economics
                    I can contribute to projects that drive both technological innovation and economic value.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I graduated with a degree in <strong>Electrical Engineering (with a focus on machine learning and controls) from the University of California, San Diego</strong>. Many of my core classes
                    started off with hardware concepts, such as analog/digital circuits as well as system stability control, but eventually I found the topics of machine learning, data analysis, 
                    and recommendation systems which were more interesting to me. In addition to these topics, I also studied <strong>Economics</strong>, taking courses to understand global markets as well as econometrics.
                    Finally, I recently completed IBM's global sales school, where I learned how to interact with potential clients through negotiation, objection handling, and managing different resources
                    as products are developed through multiple teams.
